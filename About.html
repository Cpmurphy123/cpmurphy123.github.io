        <p>I was born here in Raleigh. I am a big fan of the outdoors and I always have been. I also donâ€™t mind watching football all day on my couch or playing video games. A big part of my life is working out and practicing yoga. They both bring me peace of mind. I also have two doggos at home and their names are Ollie and Leo. Ollie is a beautiful mixed breed and Leo is a golden retriever with a big clunky head. They bring me a lot of my entertainment and they also love the outdoors too!</p>
